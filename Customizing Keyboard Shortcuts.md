#Overview
In software development, efficiency and flow state are paramount. Well-designed keybindings are crucial for developer productivity and experience within IDEs. For Gemini Code Assist, intuitive keybinding guidance is a critical differentiator for user adoption and tool effectiveness.

## Defining Keybindings

### Reusability and familiarity 

Developers have ingrained muscle memory from years of using common IDEs and applications. Avoid creating unique keybindings simply for the sake of being different and embrace patterns that they already know and love, such as Ctrl+P for quick open and Ctrl+Shift+F for global search. This minimizes cognitive friction, allowing users to focus on their work instead of recalling commands.

| ✅ Prioritize familiar IDE interaction patterns developers already know. | ❌   Don't replace a standard component with a custom design without compelling reason. | ❌  Do not enforce consistency by forcing one platform's UI onto another. |
